Have you ever feel that development is boring? lets draw an analogy. say you are given a math problem. first of all, you have to figure out a way to solve the it (what is step 1, step 2, …), and then secondly, you implement the algorithm (lets do step 1, then step 2, …). as you can see, the process can be mainly divided into two parts. thinking and implementing. I would say, most of the time, the “thinking” part is the intellectually more difficult, interesting, and challenging, compare to the “implementing” part.

now lets go to the software part. once you are done with the thinking part (thinking about the design, the logic of the software), you are just a typing machine…

I used to feel bored when I am just being a typing machine…

later on, I found I am just not passionate about what I was working on… recently, I am learning some fundamental stuff about game development (make a first person shooting game using command prompt console), although I understand the math, the logic behind the game, I was quite excited when I see the result.

So if you find development bored, chances are you just dont like it. developing something else might help (game is a good choice).

one more important thing is, our society always people to think and implement. we cant live without either one.
